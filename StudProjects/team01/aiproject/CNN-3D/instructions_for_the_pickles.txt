How to train your CNN:

0.  Anaconda prompt -> conda activate *your environment* -> cd *path to the CNN files*
conda activate "myenv" -> cd D:\Facultate2\ProiectMI\CNN-3D
1.  To make stuff run, I installed tensorflow, keras, numpy, nibabel, cv2, pickle. 
I hope I covered them all. 
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow
conda install -c anaconda keras
conda install -c anaconda numpy
conda install -c conda-forge nibabel
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install -c conda-forge pickle

2.  To get the .pickle files with the processed data, you need to run the process_data.py
	So,
		python process_data.py1

3.  (you need the files from step 2)
    To train the CNN, you simply write the command:

		python train.py

   And the program will print the training progress and the accuracy of the training.
